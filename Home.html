   <h1>About me</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/y4Og8vn.jpg">
   <p class="p1">Hello, my name is Colin Mojica-Rodriguez. 
I'm the son of two immigrants that migrated here in order to give my siblings and I a better life. 
Although my family had struggled a lot throughout the years we end up in a pretty good place.
 I am fluent in English, currently learning Spanish and I know a little bit of French. 
 I have one brother and one sister.
 My sister is the oldest and I'm the youngest in the family.
  The oldest, my sister, will be Junior in IU Bloomington and the youngest, me, will be a senior in Aresnal Tech this year.
  I will be in class of 2022 at Arsenal Tech.</p>

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p class="p2">I'm not exactly a outgoing person and it's been prove alot that I am very much an introvert, but I still do things that get my out of my house.
       One of which is a afterschool program that helps students be prepared after highschool whether that means going into college or getting a job afterwards, this program is called 
      <a href=https://www.dreamaliveinc.org/> Dream Alive.</a>
    That is what I usually spend my Friday afternoon. 
    One more thing I do that gets me to go outside is helping in construction with my dad, but since I worked with him since I was 9, do I consider it helping,working, or just a job.
    Usually how I spend my free time watching movies, videos, or playing games on my console or phone.
