   <h2>About me</h2>
   <hr class = "thickline">
   <p>Hello, my name is Colin Mojica-Rodriguez. 
I'm the son of two immigrants that migrated here in order to give my siblings and I a better life. 
Although we have struggled a lot throughout the years we end up in a pretty good condition.
 I am fluent in English, currently learning Spanish and I know a little bit of French. I have one brother and one sister.
 My sister is the oldest and I'm the youngest in the family.
  The oldest, my sister, will be Junior in IU Bloomington and the youngest, me, will be a senior this year.
  I am the class of 2022 at Arsenal Tech.</p>
