   <p class="p1">Hello, my name is Colin Mojica-Rodriguez. 
I'm the son of two immigrants that migrated here in order to give my siblings and I a better life and a better life for themselves. 
Although my family had struggled a lot throughout the years we end up in a pretty good place.
 I am fluent in English, currently learning Spanish and I know a little bit of French. 
 I have one brother and one sister.
 My sister is the oldest and I am the youngest in the family.
  The oldest, my sister, will be Junior in IU Bloomington and the youngest, me, will be a senior in Aresnal Tech this year.
  I will be in class of 2022 at Arsenal Tech.</p>

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p class="p2">I'm not exactly a outgoing person and it's been prove alot that I am very much an introvert, but I still do things that get my out of my house.
       One of which is a afterschool program that helps students be prepared after highschool whether that means going into college or getting a job afterwards, this program is called 
      <a href=https://www.dreamaliveinc.org/> Dream Alive.</a>
    That is what I usually spend my Friday afternoon. 
    One more thing I do that gets me to go outside is helping  my dad in his cosntruction business, but since I worked with him since I was 9 and get paid for working,
     do I consider it helping ,working, or just a job?
     I usually watch movies, videos, specifically anime or playing games in my free time.

  <h1>My Experience in Nextech</h1>
  <p class="p2">My honest opinion about Nextech: I have never been this interested learning anything.
      It's definitely soemething I would recommend to a student wanting to learn more about code. 
      The people here are all friendly and very helpful. It's nice to be in the same room with other people who have the same interest in coding.
